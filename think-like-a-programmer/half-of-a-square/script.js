/*

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Outputs only # and \n using only `console.log('#')` and `console.log('\n')`

BREAK THE PROBLEM DOWN:

We need a way to output a single line of five `console.log('#')` with a 
`console.log('\n')` on the end.

    Start with what we know.
    - we can use a loop to output multiple `console.log('#') 5 times.`
    - we can output `console.log('\n')` after the loop has completed.
